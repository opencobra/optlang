optlang
*******

Optlang is a Python package for solving mathematical optimization problems, i.e. maximizing or minimizing an objective function over a set of variables subject to a number of constraints.
Optlang provides a common interface to a series of optimization tools, so different solver backends can be changed in a transparent way.

Optlang takes advantage of the symbolic math library `SymPy <http://sympy.org>`_ to allow objective functions and constraints to be easily formulated from symbolic expressions of variables (see examples).

Currently supported solvers are:

* `GLPK <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_ (LP/MILP; via `swiglpk <https://github.com/biosustain/swiglpk>`_)
* `CPLEX <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/>`_ (LP/MILP/QP)
* `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ (LP/MILP/QP)
* `inspyred <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inspyred>`_ (heuristic optimization; experimental)

Support for the following solvers is in the works:

* `GAMS <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ (LP/MILP/QP/NLP; will included support for solving problems on `neos-server.org <https://neos-server.org/neos/>`_)
* `SOPLEX <http://soplex.zib.de>`_ (exact LP)
* `MOSEK <http://www.mosek.com/>`_, (LP/MILP/QP)



Quick start
===========

Consider the following linear programming optimization problem (example taken from `GLPK documentation <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk>`_):

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
        Max~ & ~ 10 x_1 + 6 x_2 + 4 x_3 \\
        s.t.~ & ~ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 <= 100 \\
        ~ & ~ 10 x_1 + 4 x_2 + 5 x_3 <= 600 \\
        ~ & ~ 2 x_1 + 2 x_2 + 6 x_3 <= 300 \\
        ~ & ~ x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0
    \end{aligned}




Formulating and solving the problem is straightforward

.. code-block:: python

   from optlang import Model, Variable, Constraint, Objective
   
   # All the (symbolic) variables are declared, with a name and optionally a lower and/or upper bound.
   x1 = Variable('x1', lb=0)
   x2 = Variable('x2', lb=0)
   x3 = Variable('x3', lb=0)
   
   # A constraint is constructed from an expression of variables and a lower and/or upper bound (lb and ub).
   c1 = Constraint(x1 + x2 + x3, ub=100)
   c2 = Constraint(10 * x1 + 4 * x2 + 5 * x3, ub=600)
   c3 = Constraint(2 * x1 + 2 * x2 + 6 * x3, ub=300)
   
   # An objective can be formulated
   obj = Objective(10 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3, direction='max')
   
   # Variables, constraints and objective are combined in a Model object, which can subsequently be optimized.
   model = Model(name='Simple model')
   model.objective = obj
   model.add([c1, c2, c3])
   status = model.optimize()
   print("status:", model.status)
   print("objective value:", model.objective.value)
   print("----------")
   for var_name, var in model.variables.items():
       print(var_name, "=", var.primal)

You should see the following output::

  status: optimal
  objective value: 733.333333333
  ----------
  x2 = 66.6666666667
  x3 = 0.0
  x1 = 33.3333333333

Quadratic programming
----------
A QP problem can be generated in the same way by creating an objective with a quadratic expression. In the above example
the objective could be :code:`obj = Objective(x1 ** 2 + x2 ** 2 - 10 * x1, direction="min")` to specify a quadratic minimization
problem.

Integer programming
----------
Integer (or mixed integer) problems can be specified by assigning the type of one or more variables to 'integer' or 'binary'.
If the solver supports integer problems it will automatically use the relevant optimization algorithm and return an integer solution.
