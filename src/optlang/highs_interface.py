"""
optlang interface for the HiGHS solver, using the highspy Python bindings.

Supports LP, QP (Quadratic Programming) and MILP (Mixed Integer Linear
Programming).
- Continuous, integer and binary variables. Note: mixing integer/binary
  variables with a quadratic objective (MIQP) is not supported by HiGHS;
  use a linear objective whenever the model contains integer/binary
  variables.
- Linear constraints.
- Linear or Quadratic objectives (continuous models only, see above).

    Unlike the earlier version of this interface, this Constraint does not keep

    straight through to the solver (mirroring the GLPK interface's design), so
    there's no local coefficient cache that can silently drift from it.

    .expression is the one exception: rebuilding it from HiGHS's row data on
    every access is expensive, so it's cached in `_expression` and only
    rebuilt when `_expression_expired` is set. Anything that changes what a
    constraint's row actually contains - a direct coefficient write, or a
    referenced variable disappearing out from under it - is responsible for
    setting that flag.

    `_initial_coeffs` is only a bootstrap value: it is parsed once at
    construction time so `_add_constraints` has something to build the HiGHS
    row from, and is never consulted again once that row exists.

    `_constant` remains local state (HiGHS rows don't carry a constant offset
    themselves, so it has to be folded into the row bounds), but a bare
    constant can never reference a variable, so it can never go stale the way
    a coefficient cache can.

    _indices that could drift out of sync with the solver's own column/row

    this dict.

    This deliberately does not subclass optlang.container.Container. That
